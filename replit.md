- Globe.gl for 3D globe rendering
- Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL (Neon)
- Three.js for advanced lighting and rendering
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using Wouter for routing
- **Backend**: Express.js with RESTful API endpoints
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **3D Visualization**: Globe.gl with Three.js
- **Data Source**: Cloudflare R2 bucket (S3 compatible)
